# Task Management System

## Project Overview
The Task Management System is a simple web-based application designed to help users create, manage, and track tasks. The system allows users to add tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.

This project was developed as part of the SEN (Software Engineering) assignment to demonstrate the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Features
- Add a new task
- View all tasks
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task

---

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Backend
- Node.js

## System Architecture
The Task Management System follows a simple client-server architecture:
- The frontend handles user interaction.
- The backend processes requests and manages task data.
- Communication between frontend and backend is done using HTTP requests (REST API).

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system is required to allow users to manage tasks efficiently by creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.

### 2. System Design
The system was designed using a client-server model with a simple data structure to store tasks.

### 3. Implementation
The application was implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js.

### 4. Testing
Manual testing was performed to ensure that all system functionalities work as expected.

### 5. Deployment
The application runs locally, and the source code is hosted on GitHub.

### 6. Maintenance
The system can be improved in the future by adding authentication, a database, and more features.
